 Onix-ceptable!
 That's a little Farfetch'd.
 Surrender now or prepare to fight fight fight. (You got it wrong, sucka.)
 Not even close.
 What kind of guess was that?
 Are you even trying? WRONG.
 How bout no.
 This is just painful.
 Did you really think that was it?
 Ooooh, so close and yet no.
 No. Just no.
 Why do you even bother?
 You aren't very good at this, are you.
 I'm very disappointed in you.
 I expected better from you.
 This isn't Digimon...
 Ten points from Hufflepuff.
 Ten points from Ravenclaw.
 That was quite possibly the worst guess ever.
 _Le sigh._
 So wrong. So very, very wrong.
 You might consider investing in a Pokedex...
 That was a terrible guess.
 Really? Do you really think that's it?
 I am so ashamed of you right now.
 Stop it, you're embarassing yourself.
 Please tell me that was a joke.
 You can't be serious.
 There's a difference between a guess and a shot in the dark.
 Please stop before you hurt yourself.
 Do you enjoy disappointing me?
 Why must you disapoint me.
 Why do I even bother.
 Please give up.
 That was terrible.
 We really need quality control.
