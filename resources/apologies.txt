Please accept my deepest apologies.
My deepest apologies. I have been a bad Zac.
My goodness, am I just the worst or what!
Oh crackers, I've done it again :disappointed:
Would you forgive me if I showed you my abs?
I can't even begin to express the depths of my sorriness.
I've been a bad, bad Efron.
This fellow is sorry. Very, very sorry.
I couldn't be sorrier :disappointed:
Well I'm just the worst aren't I.
Er, sorry 'bout that. Guess I blew it.

I hate that I have disappointed you. I will try and be better next time.

Sorry, friend. Please don't stay mad at me...

Shall I ask for forgiveness in self-perpetuating perpetuity?
Forgive me!
To err is human. Sorry for my humanness.
I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me.
Please forgive me - I didn't mean to let you down.
